Bear's Shit List

A Windower4 addon for Final Fantasy XI that lets you track and categorize other players based on your experiences with them. 
Whether someone helped you out or made your life harder, leave yourself a note so you remember next time you run into them.

## Features

- Add personal notes to any player with timestamps and keyword-based categorization
- Categories: **Positive** (green), **Negative** (red), **Neutral** (white)
- Auto-highlighting of player names in chat based on category
- On-screen overlays:
  - Party members with notes
  - Targeted players with notes
  - Shared database across multiple characters via a common file
- Wildcard search and filtering
- Sync updates automatically or manually
- Save overlay positions

## Commands

Prefix: `//sl`, `//shit`, `//pn`, or `//playernotes`


(This was previously called 'Player Notes', and has now been renamed to Shit List. All legacy commands still work)
